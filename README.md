#Emojify Server
This is a simple server that takes a string as input and returns the string with emojis. The server is written in Python and uses Flask as the web framework and I am running this on Hackclub's nest server.

I have added a bunch of emojis manually but in the future I plan to use AI to predict the emojis based on the text.
